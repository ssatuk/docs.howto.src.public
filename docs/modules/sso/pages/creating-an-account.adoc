= Creating an account for SSAT digital services
:experimental:

== Introduction

The following SSAT digital services are all connected to a single sign on (SSO) service - this means you only need to remember one username and password for all of them!

* https://discuss.ssatuk.co.uk[Discussion forums^, role="ext-link"]
* https://mylearning.ssat.cloud[SSAT MyLearning^, role="ext-link"]
* https://myportfolio.ssat.cloud[SSAT MyPortfolio^, role="ext-link"]

Before you can log in to any of these services you need to create an account in our SSO.

== Two approaches

There are two ways of logging in to these services:

* Creating a username and password in our SSO service, or
* Authenticating with a Google account

Whichever route you choose, you need to use that method from then on.
